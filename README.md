## 📦 Installation & Pretrained Models

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: An NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB of memory is necessary. The code has been verified on NVIDIA A100 and RTX 3090 GPUs.
- **Software**:   
  - The [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) is needed to compile certain submodules. The code has been tested with CUDA versions 12.1.
  - Python version 3.8 or higher is required. 

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mengmouxu/SceneGen.git
    cd SceneGen
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    Create a new conda environment named `scenegen` and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    . ./setup.sh --new-env --basic --xformers --flash-attn --diffoctreerast --spconv --mipgaussian --kaolin --nvdiffrast --demo
    ```
    The detailed usage of `setup.sh` can be found by running `. ./setup.sh --help`.

### Pretrained Models
1. First, create a directory in the SceneGen folder to store the checkpoints:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p checkpoints
    ```
2. Download the pretrained models for **SAM2-Hiera-Large** and **VGGT-1B** from [SAM2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-large/) and [VGGT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/VGGT-1B/), then place them in the `checkpoints` directory. (**SAM2** installation and its checkpoints are required for interactive generation with segmentation.)
3. Download our pretrained SceneGen model from [here](https://huggingface.co/haoningwu/SceneGen/) and place it in the `checkpoints` directory as follows:
    ```
    SceneGen/
    ├── checkpoints/
    │   ├── sam2-hiera-large
    │   ├── VGGT-1B
    │   └── scenegen
    |       ├──ckpts
    |       └──pipeline.json
    └── ...
    ```
## 💡 Inference
We provide two scripts for inference: `inference.py` for batch processing and `interactive_demo.py` for an interactive Gradio demo.

### Interactive Demo
This script launches a Gradio web interface for interactive scene generation.

- **Features**: It uses SAM2 for interactive image segmentation, allows for adjusting various generation parameters, and supports scene generation from single or multiple images.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  python interactive_demo.py
  ```
  > ## 🚀 Quick Start Guide
  >
  > ### 📷 Step 1: Input & Segment
  > 1.  **Upload your scene image.**
  > 2.  **Use the mouse to draw bounding boxes** around objects.
  > 3.  Click **"Run Segmentation"** to segment objects.
  > > *※ For multi-image generation: maintain consistent object annotation order across all images.*
  >
  > ### 🗃️ Step 2: Manage Cache
  > 1.  Click **"Add to Cache"** when satisfied with the segmentation.
  > 2.  Repeat Steps 1-2 for multiple images.
  > 3.  Use **"Delete Selected"** or **"Clear All"** to manage cached images.
  >
  > ### 🎮 Step 3: Generate Scene
  > 1.  Adjust generation parameters (optional).
  > 2.  Click **"Generate 3D Scene"**.
  > 3.  Download the generated GLB file when ready.
  >
  > **💡 Pro Tip:**  Try the examples below to get started quickly!

### Pre-segmented Image Inference
This script processes a directory of pre-segmented images.
- **Input**: The input folder structure should be similar to `assets/masked_image_test`, containing segmented scene images.
- **Visualization**: For scenes with ground truth data, you can use the `--gradio` flag to launch a Gradio interface that visualizes both the ground truth and the generated model. We provide data from the 3D-FUTURE test set as a demonstration.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  python inference.py --gradio
  ```

### Automatic Single-Image Segmentation
For raw scene photos, `inference.py` can create instance masks first and then run the existing SceneGen generation path. The default mode is `hybrid`: a zero-shot detector proposes object boxes, SAM2 refines those boxes into masks, and SAM2 automatic masks are used as a fallback when no boxes are found. The output is still the standard `masked_images_<set>/<scene_id>` folder with one `N.png` / `N_mask.png` pair per accepted instance.

```sh
python inference.py \
  --auto_segment \
  --input_image /path/to/scene.jpg \
  --output_dir outputs/my_scene \
  --set test \
  --model_name SceneGen
```

The exported GLB will be written to:

```sh
outputs/my_scene/scene_test_SceneGen/<scene_id>.glb
```

Use `--segment_only` to inspect masks before spending GPU time on the 3D generation step:

```sh
python inference.py \
  --auto_segment \
  --segment_only \
  --input_image /path/to/scene.jpg \
  --output_dir outputs/my_scene \
  --set test
```

Each scene gets an `_auto_segmentation/` debug folder containing `manifest.json`, `label_map.png`, `label_map_preview.png`, `segmentation_overlay.png`, and `mask_contact_sheet.png`. By default, person masks and room-surface masks such as walls/floors/ceilings are filtered, and large plane-like masks are not written as SceneGen batch inputs unless `--allow_low_quality_masks` is passed.

To reproduce the original interactive-demo behavior from the CLI, provide manual boxes and use SAM2 box-guided masks:

```json
[
  {"label": "bed", "bbox": [540, 700, 1600, 1450]},
  {"label": "chair", "bbox": [120, 820, 480, 1450]}
]
```

```sh
python inference.py \
  --auto_segment \
  --segmentation_mode manual_boxes \
  --boxes_json boxes.json \
  --input_image /path/to/scene.jpg \
  --output_dir outputs/my_scene \
  --set test \
  --model_name SceneGen
```

Automatic segmentation requires SAM2 to be installed and a SAM2 checkpoint to exist at `checkpoints/sam2-hiera-large/sam2_hiera_large.pt`, or pass `--sam2_checkpoint` and `--sam2_model_cfg` explicitly. Hybrid mode also uses the Transformers zero-shot detection pipeline, defaulting to `IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny`.

## 📚 Dataset
To train and evaluate SceneGen, we use the [3D-FUTURE](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/98063) dataset. Please download and preprocess the dataset as follows:
1. Download the 3D-FUTURE dataset from [here](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/98063) which requires applying for access.
2. Follow the [TRELLIS](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS) data processing instructions to preprocess the dataset. Make sure to follow their directory structure for compatibility and fully generate the necessary files and ``metadata.csv``.
3. Run the ``dataset_toolkits/build_metadata_scene.py`` script to create the scene-level metadata file:
    ```sh
    python dataset_toolkits/build_metadata_scene.py 3D-FUTURE 
    --output_dir <path_to_3D-FUTURE> 
    --set <train or test> 
    --vggt_ckpt checkpoints/VGGT-1B --save_mask
    ```
    This will generate a `metadata_scene.csv` file or a `metadata_scene_test.csv` file in the specified dataset directory.
4. For evaluation, run the ``dataset_toolkits/build_scene.sh`` script to render scene image for each scene(with Blender installed and the configs in the script set correctly):
    ```sh
    bash dataset_toolkits/build_scene.sh
    ```
    This will create a `scene_test_render` folder in the dataset directory containing the rendered images of the test scenes with Blender, which will be further used for evaluation.
## 🏋️‍♂️ Training
With the processed 3D-FUTURE dataset and the pretrained `ss_flow_img_dit_L_16l8_fp16.safetensors` model checkpoint from [TRELLIS](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/TRELLIS-image-large) correctly placed in the `checkpoints/scenegen/ckpts` directory, you can train SceneGen using the following command:
```
bash scripts/train.sh
```
For detailed training configurations, please refer to `configs/generation/ss_scenegen_flow_img_train.json` and change the parameters as needed.

## 🧪 Evaluation
To generate the 3D scenes on the 3D-FUTURE test set using the SceneGen model, use the following command:
```
bash scenegen_eval.sh
```
which will use the `scenegen_eval.py` script to generate the normalized scenes.

To evaluate the trained SceneGen model on the 3D-FUTURE test set, use the following command:
```
cd evalscene
bash eval_scenegen.sh
```
Make sure to have the processed 3D-FUTURE dataset and the rendered images in place as described in the Dataset section and the evaluation configs in `evalscene/configs/test/scene_evaluation_scenegen.yaml` set correctly. Then the evaluation script will compute metrics between the normalized generated scenes and the ground truth.

Some packages used in the evaluation require additional installation. Please install the packages: `torchmetrics`, `lpips`, `clip`, and `probreg` via pip.
